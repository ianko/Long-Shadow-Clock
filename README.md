# Long Shadow Clock for Flutter Clock Challenge

This project is my humble submission for the Flutter Clock Challenge of 2020.

The initial idea was to have a random photo from Unsplash as background, but because of the requirement to not make network requests, I didn't want to embed 60 images just for that.

Besides the long shadow, there is an animation every 10 seconds for the seconds digits, and on every change on the minutes and hours digits.
